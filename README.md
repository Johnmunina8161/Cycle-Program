# Cycle-Program
Cycle is a game where the players try to cut each other off using cycles that leave a trail behind them.
Players can move up, down, left and right...
Player one moves using the W , S, A and D keys.
Player two moves using the I, K, J and L keys.
Each player's trail grows as they move.
Players try to maneuver so the opponent collides with their trail.
If a player collides with their opponent's trail...
A "game over" message is displayed in the middle of the screen.
The cycles turn white.
Players keep moving and turning but don't run into each other.
